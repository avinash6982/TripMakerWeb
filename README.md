## 💡 What is TripMaker?

TripMaker solves the fragmentation of traditional trip planning by providing:

1. **Visual Planning** - See your entire trip on an interactive map
2. **Day-wise Breakdown** - Timeline view of activities per day
3. **Real-time Tracking** - Live location during trip execution *(MVP3)*
4. **Collaboration** - Invite friends, share itineraries *(MVP2)*
5. **Trip Memories** - Keep all trip photos and stories in one place *(MVP3)*
