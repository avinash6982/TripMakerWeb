# TripMaker Monorepo Rules

## Project Structure
This is a monorepo containing:
- Frontend: React/Vite app in `apps/frontend/`
- Backend: Express.js API in `apps/backend/`

## Development Guidelines

### General
- Use npm workspaces for dependency management
- Follow consistent code style across frontend and backend
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test changes locally before pushing

### Frontend (apps/frontend/)
- React with Vite
- Use functional components and hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow React best practices
- Use i18next for internationalization

### Backend (apps/backend/)
- Express.js with modern ES6+ syntax
- Use proper middleware (helmet, cors, rate-limiting)
- Implement JWT authentication
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Document APIs with Swagger

### File Changes
- When modifying frontend, work in `apps/frontend/`
- When modifying backend, work in `apps/backend/`
- Root-level changes affect the entire monorepo

### Deployment
- Push to main branch triggers Vercel deployment
- Frontend deploys to root path
- Backend deploys to `/api/*` routes
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Commands
- `npm run dev` - Run both apps in development
- `npm run dev:frontend` - Run only frontend
- `npm run dev:backend` - Run only backend
- `npm run build` - Build both apps
- `npm install` - Install all dependencies

## API Integration
- Backend API should be accessed at `/api/*` in production
- Use proper CORS configuration
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
