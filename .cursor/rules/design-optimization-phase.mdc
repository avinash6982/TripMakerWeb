# Design Optimization Phase (Post-MVP3)

## Current Phase

**Design Optimization** is the active phase. MVP3 is complete. MVP4 has not started. This phase is **feedback-driven**: the user reviews design elements, page structure, styles, and overall UI and provides specific feedback. Each change is implemented **in isolation** to avoid regressions and repeated issues.

---

## Scope

### In scope
- **Visual design:** Colors, typography, spacing, borders, shadows, icons.
- **Page structure:** Layout, section order, header/footer placement, component arrangement.
- **Component styling:** Buttons, cards, forms, lists, modals, empty states, loading states.
- **Responsiveness:** Breakpoints, mobile vs desktop layout, touch targets.
- **Consistency:** Aligning pages with the standard page header, icon buttons, empty states (see `ui-icon-buttons.mdc`).
- **Accessibility:** Contrast, focus states, aria-labels (no new features; polish only).

### Out of scope
- **New features** (e.g. new pages, new API endpoints, new user flows).
- **MVP4 work** (marketplace, paid APIs, booking) — do not start until user explicitly ends Design Optimization and approves MVP4.
- **Backend logic changes** unless required to support a purely presentational change (e.g. exposing existing data for layout).
- **New dependencies** unless the user explicitly requests a specific library for design.

## Workflow: One change at a time

1. **User provides feedback** — e.g. "Make the trip card title larger on mobile" or "Add more spacing between the gallery thumbnails."
2. **Implement exactly that change** — Single, isolated edit. Do not refactor unrelated code or "improve" other areas in the same commit.
3. **Verify** — Run the app, check the changed screen/component, ensure no console errors and no broken layout elsewhere.
4. **Done** — Wait for the next feedback item. Do not batch multiple design requests into one change unless the user explicitly asks for it.

### Why isolation matters
- Reduces risk of regressions (e.g. fixing one page and breaking another).
- Makes it easy to revert a single change if the user doesn’t like it.
- Keeps diffs and code reviews focused.
- Avoids "repeated issues" from large, multi-file touch-ups.

---

## Applying feedback

- **Be literal:** Implement what the user asked for. If something is ambiguous, ask once (e.g. "Do you want the same spacing on the Feed cards as on Trip cards?").
- **Stay scoped:** If the user says "trip detail header," change only the trip detail header (or the shared page-header component if that’s the agreed standard), not every page.
- **Preserve behavior:** Design-only changes must not change logic, routes, or data flow. Exception: moving a button to a different place is allowed; changing what the button does is not unless the user asks.
- **Document if needed:** If a design change affects a shared component (e.g. `.page-header`), note it in the commit or in `DESIGN_OPTIMIZATION.md` so later feedback can stay consistent.

---

## When this phase ends

- The user will **acknowledge** when they are done giving design feedback (e.g. "Design optimization is done" or "Ready for MVP4").
- Do **not** assume the phase is over until then.
- After acknowledgment, update docs (e.g. `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`, `MVP_ROADMAP.md`) to mark Design Optimization complete and set the next phase to MVP4 (with explicit user approval to start MVP4).

## Quick reference

| Do | Don’t |
|----|--------|
| One design change per feedback item | Batch many unrelated UI changes |
| Restrict changes to the requested screen/component | Refactor whole app in one go |
| Test after each change | Skip verification |
| Use existing design tokens (variables.css) | Introduce new design systems without asking |
| Ask if feedback is unclear | Guess and implement something different |
| Wait for user to signal phase complete | Start MVP4 on your own |
