# MVP Development Discipline

## Current Phase: **MVP2 - Collaboration & Community**

### Phase Status
- **Started:** Jan 31, 2026 (MVP1 complete; unarchive added)
- **Target Completion:** TBD
- **Demo Status:** ✅ Always demo-ready
- **MVP1:** 100% complete (trip CRUD, archive, unarchive, map, transport hubs, etc.)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Transactional Development
**Every commit must result in a working application**

- ✅ All features must be complete and functional
- ✅ No half-implemented features in main branch
- ✅ Use feature flags for work-in-progress
- ❌ Never commit broken code
- ❌ Never commit features that crash the app

### 2. Scope Discipline
**Stay within current MVP phase unless explicitly told otherwise**

- ✅ Only implement features from current phase
- ✅ Document any scope expansion requests
- ❌ Don't add "nice to have" features
- ❌ Don't jump to future MVP phases

### 3. Zero-Cost Constraint
**All MVP1-3 features must work without paid services**

- ✅ Use mock data for AI suggestions
- ✅ Use free geocoding APIs (Nominatim)
- ✅ Use Vercel free tier
- ❌ Don't integrate paid AI services yet
- ❌ Don't use premium APIs

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task
1. ✅ Confirm feature is in current MVP phase
2. ✅ Check if it can be done without paid services
3. ✅ Plan how to keep app working during development
4. ✅ Identify what tests are needed

### During Development
1. ✅ Use feature branches for complex features
2. ✅ Test after every significant change
3. ✅ Keep backend and frontend in sync
4. ✅ Update API documentation if adding endpoints

### Before Committing
1. ✅ Test full user flow end-to-end
2. ✅ Ensure no console errors
3. ✅ Verify app loads without crashes
4. ✅ Update relevant documentation
5. ✅ Run `npm run dev` successfully

---

## Testing Requirements

### Must Test Before Commit
- [ ] App starts without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] All existing features still work
- [ ] New feature works as expected
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] API endpoints return expected data

### Test User
Always use: `dev@tripmaker.com` / `DevUser123!`

---

## Documentation Updates

### Auto-Update These Files
- `MVP_ROADMAP.md` - Progress tracking
- `API_REFERENCE.md` - New endpoints
- `APP_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture changes
- `README.md` - Major feature additions

---

## Decision Framework

### Should I Implement This Feature?

```
Is it in current MVP phase?
├─ NO → STOP. Document request, wait for explicit approval
└─ YES
   │
   Does it require paid services?
   ├─ YES → Can it use mock/free alternatives?
   │  ├─ NO → STOP. Discuss with user first
   │  └─ YES → Proceed with free alternative
   └─ NO → Proceed
      │
      Will it keep the app working?
      ├─ NO → Use feature flag or branch strategy
      └─ YES → Implement fully, test, commit
```

---

## Example: Good vs Bad Commits

### ✅ GOOD
```
feat: add trip creation with map markers (MVP1)

- Add POST /trips endpoint for trip persistence
- Integrate Leaflet.js for map visualization
- Display destination marker on map
- Add trip list view on home page
- Tests: All existing features work, new trip flow tested
```

### ❌ BAD
```
wip: started adding trip creation

- Added some API code (not finished)
- Map component broken
- TODO: Fix markers
```

---

## Current Phase Checklist

### MVP1 Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Implement trip data model (User → Trips relationship)
- [ ] Create trip persistence API endpoints
- [ ] Add map component to frontend
- [ ] Build day-wise breakdown view
- [ ] Implement trip editing
- [ ] Add trip status management
- [ ] Create mock data for transportation hubs

**Do NOT proceed to MVP2 until ALL MVP1 tasks are complete and user explicitly approves.**
