# 🗺️ TripMaker MVP Roadmap

**Last Updated:** January 31, 2026 (MVP2 complete, MVP3 unblocked)  
**Current Phase:** MVP3 - Advanced Features  
**Overall Progress:** MVP1 100%; MVP2 100%; MVP3 ready to start

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional trip planning is fragmented and requires heavy manual coordination:
- ❌ Multiple tools for planning, tracking, and collaboration
- ❌ Difficult to visualize entire trip flow
- ❌ Hard to coordinate with travel companions
- ❌ No centralized place for trip memories

## Solution

**TripMaker (Waypoint)** provides an all-in-one platform for trip planning, execution, and memories:
- ✅ Visual map-based trip planning
- ✅ Day-wise itinerary breakdown
- ✅ Real-time collaboration
- ✅ Public trip sharing and inspiration
- ✅ Trip memory preservation

---

## Development Principles

### 1. Transactional Development
- **Every commit = working demo**
- No half-implemented features in main
- Use feature flags for WIP

### 2. Zero-Cost MVP (Phases 1-3)
- Use free geocoding APIs
- Mock data for AI suggestions
- Vercel free tier hosting
- No paid services until MVP4+

### 3. Scope Discipline
- Only implement current phase features
- Document scope change requests
- Get explicit approval before jumping phases

1. ✅ Confirm it's in current MVP phase
2. ✅ Check zero-cost constraint
3. ✅ Break into atomic tasks
4. ✅ Plan testing strategy

### During Development
1. ✅ Keep app working (feature flags if needed)
2. ✅ Test after each commit
3. ✅ Update docs in same commit
4. ✅ Use dev user for testing

### Before Marking Complete
1. ✅ All tasks checked off
2. ✅ Full feature tested end-to-end
3. ✅ No console errors
4. ✅ Documentation updated
5. ✅ Deployed to Vercel
6. ✅ Production testing done

## Decision Log

### January 30, 2026
- ✅ Decided to use Leaflet.js for maps (free, open-source)
- ✅ Decided to use file-based storage for MVP1 (Vercel /tmp)
- ✅ Decided to use Nominatim for geocoding (free, OSM)
- ✅ Decided against Google Maps API (paid, over-budget for MVP1)

### January 31, 2026
- 📝 Created MVP roadmap with atomic task breakdown
- 📝 Established transactional development principle
- 📝 Set up Cursor rules for scope discipline
- 🧹 Removed redundant documentation summaries and setup/deploy notes

---

## Risk Management

### Known Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Ephemeral Vercel storage | Data loss on redeployment | Document limitation, plan DB migration for MVP2 |
| Free API rate limits | Service degradation | Implement caching, fallback to mock data |
| Map performance | Slow rendering with many markers | Limit markers, add clustering in MVP2 |
| Scope creep | Delayed delivery | Strict Cursor rules, explicit approval required |

---

## Success Criteria

### MVP1 Success
- ✅ User can plan a complete trip without leaving the app
- ✅ Trip visualization is clear and intuitive
- ✅ All features work on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Zero crashes or critical bugs
- ✅ App remains demo-ready throughout development

### Long-term Success
- 🎯 1000+ registered users
- 🎯 500+ public trips shared
- 🎯 Active collaboration on 100+ trips
- 🎯 Positive user feedback on UX

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (MVP3)
1. Define MVP3 task breakdown (timeline prefs, real-time location, live map, ETA, chat, like/comment, share)
2. Start with P0: real-time location tracking + live map with current location
3. Then: in-trip chat, like/comment on feed, share externally

### Deferred from MVP2 (optional in MVP3)
- Enhanced trip suggestions (scraping/community)
- Live location integration (browser Geolocation, distance to start)
